**GT-Helper**

**First Android app - interacts with Google Translate**

This application guides the user how to use Google Translate's camera, to
translate text from Hebrew to Polish, in order to read aloud the Polish text.

This process was done, because reading aloud Hebrew text is not supported in GT.

The application was tested on Samsung Galaxy A70 device (resolution of
1080\*2400).

**First screen:** The user is directed, vocally, to press the orange button
twice;

this results in launching Google Translate app and showing GT's camera.

**Second screen:**

The user has to press the black button twice;

This results in going back to GT's camera and pressing "Scan" button.

This reflects the recent changes done in Google Translate, summer 2019.

Now, the user is being vocally directed with further instructions, which are
being performed right after pressing "Scan" button. These are:

"Press the circle to scan" and then "Press the white ellipse".

After these instructions, the user is redirected to the next screen.

**Third screen:** A green strip is presented on this screen;

the user has to press this strip twice, to go to GT's translation screen:

**Fourth screen:** after taking the photo with GT's camera and going to
translation,

we now have a blank screen. On this screen, the user has to swipe up using
finger.

**Fifth screen:** The user has to press the red button;

This results in copying the translated text from GT, to the clipboard.

Now, the user will hear the translated text read aloud, in Polish.
